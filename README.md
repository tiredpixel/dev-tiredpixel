Public notes, migrated from Gists.

I am leaving Gists behind; they're not very portable, at least as a collection,
and I find them tricksy to search.

This repository has *notebook* status, meaning that it is released in the hope
it will be useful, but it is not under active development and there are no
releases planned.


## Blessing

May you find peace, and help others to do likewise.
