Public notes, migrated from Gists.

I am leaving Gists behind; they're not very portable, at least as a collection,
and I find them tricksy to search.

This repository has *notebook* status, meaning that it is released in the hope
it will be useful, but it is not under active development and there are no
releases planned.


## Blessing

May you find peace, and help others to do likewise.


## Licence

Many of the snippets in this repository are so short as for me to not consider
them copyrightable. Other snippets might have been based on other sources, so
even to attach a copyright doesn't seem accurate. For newer, longer snippets,
I'll attempt to add an explicit licence in the directory or source files. For
an older snippet, please get in touch if it bothers you.
