# Setting up dnsmasq on Ubuntu (working with Network Manager), allowing subdomains
# for Apache
# 
# This will enable subdomain.vmhostname to be resolved without having to explicitly
# add it to `/etc/hosts`.

# install dnsmasq
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

# uncomment the following line in `/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf`:
prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1; 

# add entry to `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` with correct IP:
address=/vmhostname/192.168.56.2

# restart dnsmasq
sudo service dnsmasq restart

# verify can reach entry
ping vmhostname
ping subdomain.vmhostname
